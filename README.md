# Emulation-Station
<p>This project can be done on a Raspberry Pi running Emulation Station, besides the possibility of runing ROMs for multiple
retro consoles, the more interesting part of this project is the installation of a steam link like client for streaming games
over a LAN.</p>
<p>In this case the streamming is done using Moonlight, an open source Nvidia GameStream client, note that this project only
works if you have an nvidia graphics card on your PC.</p>
<P>Moonlight for Emulation Station can be installed using this script:
