# Emulation-Station
<p>This project can be done on a Raspberry Pi running Emulation Station, besides the possibility of runing ROMs for multiple
retro consoles, the more interesting part of this project is the installation of a steam link like client for streaming games
over a LAN.</p>

Help with transfering ROMs using SFTP to the system can be found [here.](https://github.com/retropie/retropie-setup/wiki/Transferring-Roms)

<p>In this case the streaming is done using Moonlight, an open source Nvidia GameStream client, note that this project only
works if you have an nvidia graphics card on your PC.</p>

Moonlight for Emulation Station can be installed with wget using [this script.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TechWizTime/moonlight-retropie/master/moonlight.sh)
<p>Using this build I managed to have some fun playing video games that I used to play on my first Pentium computer as a kid,
  I was also able to run it in my father's car by connecting the Raspberry Pi to a 12v screen, in that picture my little brother is playing the original Wolfenstein for the first time.</p>
